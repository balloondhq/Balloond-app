# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app's image assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (32x32)

## Placeholder Note

These are placeholder references. You'll need to add actual image files:

1. **App Icon**: Create a square icon with the balloon logo
2. **Splash Screen**: Design with brand colors (bone/cream background, ruby accent)
3. **Adaptive Icon**: Android-specific icon with transparent background

## Recommended Design

- Use the ruby burgundy (#8B0000) as primary color
- Bone/cream (#FAF7F2) as background
- Include a balloon shape in the logo
- Keep design minimal and modern
